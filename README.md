# ExpressRoutingClean

This is my implementation of the demo app for the article found at: 
https://scotch.io/tutorials/keeping-api-routing-clean-using-express-routers

Trying to follow along the examples, I ran into issues with array functions not available to me ( .find() )
and arrow function syntax ( => ) and such, also backticks (`) weren't being recognized by the my node setup.

As the demo tried to keep things simple, I was able to keep find alternate solutions by googling around.

Enjoy!
